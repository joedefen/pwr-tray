# pwr-tray

`pwr-tray` is a PyQt5 Tray Applet for Power/Energy Saving and System/DE Controls. Tested DEs include i3wm, swaywm, Hyprland, and KDE (X11 and Wayland). Additional DEs with built-in configs: XFCE, Cinnamon, MATE, and LXQt. `systemd` is required. The `pwr-tray` menu will look similar to:

</p>


With just a right-click and a left-click, you can do most operations such as change to Presentation Mode, change screen lock and sleep timeouts, log off, lock and blank your monitors, and more. The `pwr-tray` icon changes based on state:

### Requirements
* **Python** 3.8+ with **PyQt5** (5.15+) and **ruamel.yaml** (0.17+)
* **systemd** (for `systemctl`, `loginctl`, `systemd-inhibit`)
* **pipx** (recommended for installation)

Per-DE requirements:

| DE | Required Packages | Notes |
|----|-------------------|-------|
| **i3wm** | `i3lock`, `xprintidle`, `xset` | X11 only; `xss-lock` recommended (see below) |
| **sway** | `swaylock`, `swayidle` (1.8+) | `pwr-tray` manages `swayidle` |
| **Hyprland** | `swaylock`, `swayidle` (1.8+) | `pwr-tray` manages `swayidle` |
| **KDE Wayland** | `swayidle` (1.8+) | Requires **Plasma 6**; `pwr-tray` manages `swayidle` |
| **KDE X11** | `xprintidle`, `xset` | Plasma 6 (Plasma 5 untested); `qdbus`/`qdbus6` auto-detected |
| **XFCE** | `xprintidle`, `xset` | X11 only |
| **Cinnamon** | `xprintidle`, `xset` | X11 only |
| **MATE** | `xprintidle`, `xset` | X11 only |
| **LXQt** | `xprintidle`, `xset` | X11 only |

**Distro notes:**
* Developed and tested on **Debian 13 (trixie)**. Should work on any distro with sufficiently recent packages.
* KDE Wayland support requires **Plasma 6** (uses the `org.kde.Shutdown` D-Bus API) and **swayidle 1.8+** (for `ext-idle-notify-v1` protocol support).
* Debian 12 (bookworm) and Ubuntu 24.04 ship Plasma 5 and swayidle 1.7 -- KDE Wayland will **not** work on those. i3 and sway should be fine.
* Arch Linux and Fedora 40+ ship current versions and should work for all DEs.

### HowTo Install and Start pwr-tray
* Basically: `pipx install pwr-tray` (exactly how depends on your installation and its state)
* Manually run as `pwr-tray -o`:
    * Creates config (in `~/.config/pwr-tray/config.ini`).
    * Copies default DE commands to `~/.config/pwr-tray/commands.yaml`.
    * Shows system-level commands (DE dependent) that must be installed if missing. Note:
      * `systemctl` is always required.
      * Optionally, install `playerctl` if you wish playing media to inhibit screen saving and sleeping.
    * If you find you are missing PyQt5, then you'll need to install it; examples:
        * `sudo apt install python3-pyqt5` # if debian based
        * `sudo pacman -S python-pyqt5` # if arch based
        * `sudo dnf install python3-qt5` # if fedora based

* Then, follow the "Per-DE Specific Notes" below to ensure proper operation. To just kick the tires, you can defer this until ready to go forward.
* Read the other sections for customization and everyday use.
* From the CLI, you can start/restart pwr-tray in the background with `setsid pwr-tray`; typically, you will "autostart" `pwr-tray` when you log in however your DE/WM manages autostarts.

### Command Line Options
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-o`, `--stdout` | Log to stdout (in addition to the log file); useful for debugging from a terminal. |
| `-D`, `--debug` | Enable debug mode (more frequent/elaborate logging); overrides the `debug_mode` config setting. |
| `-q`, `--quick` | Quick mode: sets lock and sleep timeouts to 1 minute and runs double-time (timers expire in 30s wall clock). Useful for testing. |
| `-e`, `--edit-config` | Open `~/.config/pwr-tray/config.ini` in `$EDITOR` (default: `vim`). |
| `-f`, `--follow-log` | Tail the log file (`~/.config/pwr-tray/debug.log`). |
| `--de NAME` | Force desktop detection (e.g., `--de i3-x11`, `--de sway-wayland`, `--de kde-wayland`). Useful when env vars are unreliable. |

For initial setup and troubleshooting, `pwr-tray -D -o` is a good starting point.

### HowTo Use pwr-tray
Open the `pwr-tray` menu with a right-click. Then left-click a line to have an effect ...

Choose from three *major power modes* (to control the effects of timeouts):
- **🅟 Presentation ⮜** -  Keeps the screen unlocked/on and system up.
- **🅛 LockOnly ⮜** - Keeps the system up, but the screen may lock.
- **🅢 SleepAfterLock ⮜** - Allows screen locking and system to go down (the "normal" mode).

Or choose from various locking/blanking/DE operations:
- **▷ Lock Screen** - locks the screen immediately.
- **▷ Blank Monitors** - blanks the screen after locking the screen.
- **▷ Reload** - various DE-dependent actions (reload WM config, etc.).
- **▷ Log Off** - terminate your user session.

Or choose a new *system state*:
- **▼ Suspend System** - suspends the system immediately.
- **▼ Reboot System** - reboots the system immediately.
- **▼ Poweroff System** - power down the system immediately.

Next, you may see:
- **🗲 Plugged In** (or HiBattery or LoBattery). Shows the state of the battery.
- **♺ Chg Screen Idle: 15m->30m** - change the time to start the screen saver; each time clicked, it changes to the next choice.
- **♺ Chg System Idle: 5m->30m** - change the time to take the system down; clicking selects the next choice.
- **🎝 PlayerCtl** - shows the state (not installed, enabled, disabled); if installed, a click toggles whether playing media inhibits screen locking and sleeping.

Or act on the applet itself:
- **🖹  Edit Applet Config** - edit the applet's .ini file.
- **☓ Quit this Applet** -  exit applet.
- **↺ Restart this Applet** - restart applet.

### Testing pwr-tray
- Running `pwr-tray --quick` reduces the lock and sleep timeout to 1 minute (although you can 'click' the current value to try others), and `--quick` runs double-time (so 1 minute timers expire in 30s per the wall clock).
- You can run in various modes, but the default, `SleepAfterLock`, exercises the most code paths.
- Then, ensure closing the lid, hitting the power button, etc., have the desired effects.
- To test systemd inhibits: create a test inhibit with `systemd-inhibit --why="Prevent sleep for demonstration" sleep infinity`
- To test Hi/Lo Battery states (only on a system w/o a battery), click the battery state which artificially changes to HiBattery or LoBattery states for testing behaviors in those states.

### HowTo Configure pwr-tray

#### config.ini
- When the program is started w/o a `config.ini`, that file is created with defaults.
- It has three sections:
    * **Settings**: The settings for when plugged in.  Missing/invalid settings are inherited from the defaults. Here are the defaults:
    * **HiBattery**: The settings for when on battery on and not a low battery condition.  Missing/invalid settings are inherited from 'Settings'.
    * **LoBattery**: The settings for when on battery in a low battery condition.  Missing/invalid settings are inherited from 'Settings'.

Here are the current 'Settings' defaults with explanation.
```
    [Settings]
    debug_mode = False                  # more frequent and elaborate logging
    power_down = False                  # power down (rather than suspend)
    turn_off_monitors = False           # turn off monitors after locking screen
    lock_min_list = [15, 30]            # lock minutes choices
    sleep_min_list = [5, 30]            # sleep minutes choices (after lock)
    lo_battery_pct = 10                 # define "low battery" state
    gui_editor = geany                  # gui editor for .ini file
```
**NOTES**:
* If you have issues with monitors failing to sleep or the system cannot wake when the monitors are off, then disable the `turn_off_monitors` feature.
* You can set `gui_editor = konsole -e vim`, for example, to use vim in a terminal window.  If you don't have `geany` installed, then be sure to change `gui_editor`.
* `pwr-tray` changes directory to `~/.config/pwr-tray`.
* Your picks of mode, timeouts, etc. are saved to disk when changed, and restored on the next start.
* Items may be absent depending on the mode and battery state.
- **NOTE**: when in LoBattery, SleepAfterLock becomes the effective mode. The icon will change per your selection and the battery state.

#### commands.yaml (DE commands)
On each startup, `pwr-tray` copies its built-in `commands.yaml` to `~/.config/pwr-tray/commands.yaml` so you can always see the current defaults. To customize DE commands (e.g., fix a logoff command, change the locker, add a new DE):

1. Copy `commands.yaml` to `my-commands.yaml` in the same folder:
   ```
   cp ~/.config/pwr-tray/commands.yaml ~/.config/pwr-tray/my-commands.yaml
   ```
2. Edit `my-commands.yaml` as needed.
3. Restart `pwr-tray`.

`pwr-tray` loads `my-commands.yaml` if it exists, otherwise falls back to the built-in `commands.yaml`. The `my-commands.yaml` file is never overwritten by `pwr-tray`.

The config uses a three-layer merge: **defaults** → **session_type** (x11 or wayland) → **desktop**. Later layers override earlier ones. Desktop entries are keyed by compound names like `i3-x11` or `kde-wayland`; the part before the last `-` is matched against environment variables (`$XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP`, `$XDG_SESSION_DESKTOP`, `$DESKTOP_SESSION`), and the suffix must match `$XDG_SESSION_TYPE`.

## Running pwr-tray as a systemd Service

Instead of your DE/WM's own autostart, you can run `pwr-tray` as a `systemd --user` service. That restarts the applet if it exits and keeps its logging consistent regardless of how the session was started. Save the unit below as `~/.config/systemd/user/pwr-tray.service`, then:

```
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user ~/.local/log
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now pwr-tray.service
```

Example unit for **sway / Wayland**:

```
[Unit]
Description=pwr-tray (power/energy tray applet)

### Example systemd Service Config for other DEs/WMs

* [i3](docs/examples/pwr-tray-i3.service)
* [Hyprland](docs/examples/pwr-tray-hyprland.service)
* [KDE X11](docs/examples/pwr-tray-kde-x11.service)
* [KDE Wayland](docs/examples/pwr-tray-kde-wayland.service)
* [XFCE](docs/examples/pwr-tray-xfce.service)
* [Cinnamon](docs/examples/pwr-tray-cinnamon.service)
* [MATE](docs/examples/pwr-tray-mate.service)
* [LXQt](docs/examples/pwr-tray-lxqt.service)

### systemd Service Caveats

* A `systemd --user` service is **not tied to a DE/WM**. With `WantedBy=graphical-session.target` it starts in *any* graphical session on your account, so on a machine where you switch between DEs it will also launch under the others (and, with `--de` forced, then act on the wrong session). To limit it, bind it to a WM-specific target or add a condition line such as `ConditionEnvironment=XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=sway`.
* `systemd --user` does not inherit your session environment, so the variables above are set explicitly.
* Do **not** enable the service *and* a DE/WM autostart for the same session, or you will get two tray icons.
* Keep the standard `PATH` entries -- `pwr-tray` calls `systemctl`, `loginctl`, `pgrep`/`pkill`, `swayidle`, `swaymsg`, and friends from `/usr/bin`.

## Per-DE Specific Notes

### i3wm Specific Notes
* Uninstall or disable all competing energy saving programs (e.g., `xscreensaver`, `xfce4-power-manager`, etc.) when running `i3` whether started by `systemd` or `i3/config` or whatever; defeat the X11 defaults somehow such as in `~/.config/i3/config`:
```
        exec --no-startup-id xset s off ; xset s noblank ; xset -dpms
```
* **Recommended**: Install `xss-lock` and configure it in your i3 config to handle lid close and power button events:
```
set $screenlock i3lock -t -i ~/.config/pwr-tray/lockpaper.png --ignore-empty-password --show-failed-attempts
exec --no-startup-id xss-lock --transfer-sleep-lock -- $screenlock --nofork
bindsym XF86PowerOff exec --no-startup-id $screenlock && systemctl suspend
bindsym $mod+Escape exec --no-startup-id $screenlock  # create shortcut to lock screen only
```
* Edit `/etc/systemd/logind.conf` and uncomment `HandlePowerKey=` and `HandleLidSwitch=`, set each action to `suspend`, and then either reboot or restart `systemd-logind`.
* Finally, start `pwr-tray` as a systemd service (see above) or some other way. For example, a simplest case using `i3status`, though it may depend on your status bar:
```
        bar {
            status_command i3status
            tray_output primary
        }
        exec_always --no-startup-id ~/.local/bin/pwr-tray
```
* If you use `polybar` for status, then it may be best to run `pwr-tray` from polybar's 'launch' script; e.g., `sleep 1.5 && setsid ~/.local/bin/pwr-tray &`;  the delay may be need to allow time for the tray to become ready.

### sway Specific Notes
* Uninstall or disable any **other** `swayidle` instances or competing energy savers. `pwr-tray` manages its own `swayidle` process and will kill any stray instances on startup.
* **NOTE**: on `sway`, `pwr-tray` cannot read the idle time directly; instead, it manages a `swayidle` process whose arguments vary with your settings.
* Edit `/etc/systemd/logind.conf` and uncomment `HandlePowerKey=` and `HandleLidSwitch=`, and set each action to `suspend`; then either reboot or restart `systemd-logind`.  That enables the ever-running `swayidle` to handle the suspend / resume events.
* Again, start `pwr-tray` as a systemd service (see above) or find another way; for example, adding to sway's config: `exec_always --no-startup-id sleep 2 && ~/.local/bin/pwr-tray` -- a delay may be required to let the tray initialize.

### Hyprland Specific Notes
* Disable any other idle managers. `pwr-tray` manages its own `swayidle` process.
* Start `pwr-tray` as a systemd service (see above) or, for example, via Hyprland's `exec-once`:
```
exec-once = sleep 2 && ~/.local/bin/pwr-tray
```
* Screen locking uses `swaylock`; monitor control uses `hyprctl dispatch dpms`.

### KDE Specific Notes
* In Settings/Energy Saving, disable "Screen Energy Saving", "Suspend session", etc., except keep the "Button events handling" and make it as you wish (e.g., "When power button pressed", "Sleep").
* Start it as a systemd service (see above), or in Settings/AutoStart add the full path of `~/.local/bin/pwr-tray`.
* `qdbus` (or `qdbus6` on Plasma 6) is required for X11; `pwr-tray` auto-detects which is available.
* On **KDE Wayland**, `swayidle` is required (install it if missing). `pwr-tray` manages `swayidle` for idle timeout handling. Locking uses `loginctl lock-session`.
* On **KDE X11**, idle time is read via `xprintidle` and screen locking uses `loginctl lock-session`.

### Other DEs (XFCE, Cinnamon, MATE, LXQt)
* These DEs have built-in configs that should work out of the box on X11.
* Disable any competing energy saving features in the DE's own power settings.
* Screen locking uses `loginctl lock-session` (the DE provides the lock handler).
* If the built-in commands don't work for your setup, create a `my-commands.yaml` override (see above).
