# pwr-tray
A GTK Tray Applet for Power/Energy Saving and System/DE Controls.

Currently supported/tested DEs are:
* i3wm
* KDE on X11

In the plans are:
* Support for these DEs:
    * swaywm
    * KDE on Wayland
    * Gnome on X11
    * Gnome on Wayland
* And, imaginably, an AppImage that bundles all the system requirements since pip/pipx
does not deal with those.

---

### Install
* Basically: `pipx install pwr-tray` (exactly how depends on your installation and its state)
* Plus, various system modules and executables.
* Manually run as `pwr-tray -o`:
    * Creates config (in `~/.config/pwr-tray/config.ini`).
    * Shows missing, required system-level imports (DE dependent).
        * See "Installing Needed System Python Modules" (immediately below).
    * Shows missing system-level commands (DE dependent). Install per distro instructions.
* When running manually, see the "Per-Distro Specific Notes" below for its configuration.
* Finally, see the "Using pwr-tray" for everyday use after install.

#### Installing Needed System Python Modules
* On Debian, use `sudo apt install ...` of:
    * python3-gi python3-gi-cairo gir1.2-gtk-3.0
    * gir1.2-appindicator3-0.1 libappindicator3-1
* On Debian 12 and others?, if the above is not working, try:
    * python3-gi python3-gi-cairo gir1.2-gtk-3.0
    * gir1.2-notify-0.7 gir1.2-ayatanaappindicator3-0.1 ayatanalibappindicator3-1
* On Arch, use `pacman -Syy ...` of:
    * libappindicator-gtk3 python-gobject python-cairo
* On other distros, use the hints above to resolve an missing "imports".

## Using pwr-tray

### Manual Launch of the Applet
- For foreground in terminal, run `pwr-tray -o` ("-o" logs to stdout).
- In the background, run `pwr-tray & disown` (logs to `~/.config/pwr-tray/debug.log`).
### Other Forms of pwr-tray
- `pwr-tray -e` edits the config file (`~/.config/pwr-ini/config.ini`)
- `pwr-tray -f` tails the log file (`~/.config/pwr-ini/debug.log`)

# Configuration Basics
- When the program is started w/o a `config.ini`, then it is created with defaults.
- It has three sections:
    * **Settings**: The settings for when plugged in.  Missing/invalid settings are inherited from the defaults. Here are the defaults:
    * **HiBattery**: The settings for when on battery on and not a low battery condition.  Missing/invalid settings are inherited from 'Settings'.
    * **LoBattery**: The settings for when on battery in a low battery condition.  Missing/invalid settings are inherited from 'Settings'.

Here are the current 'Settings' defaults with explanation.
```
[Settings]
i3lock_args = -t -i ./lockpaper.png # arguments when running i3lock
debug_mode = False                  # more frequent and elaborate logging
power_down = False                  # power down (rather than Suspend)
turn_off_monitors = False           # turn off monitors after locking screen
lock_min_list = [15, 30]            # lock minutes choices
sleep_min_list = [5, 30]            # sleep minutes choices (after lock)
lo_battery_pct = 10                 # define "low battery" state
```

### Tray Menu 
Notes:
* `pwr-tray` changes directory to `~/.config/pwr-tray`.
* If .ini file is missing, it is created and `lockpaper.png` is copied there too.
* Your picks of mode and times are saved to disk when changed, and restored on the next start.
* Items may be absent depending on the mode and battery state.

Choose from three *major power modes* (to limit the effect of timeouts):
- **â˜€ PRESENTATION Mode** -  Keeps the screen unlocked/on and system up.
- **â˜€ LockOnly Mode** - Keeps the system up, but the screens may lock.
- **â˜€ SleepAfterLock Mode** - Allows screen locking and system to go down (the "normal" mode).
  **NOTE**: when in LoBattery, SleepAfterLock is in effect.
The icon will change per your selection and the battery state.

Next you may see:
- **ðŸ—² Plugged In** (or HiBattery or LoBattery). If you click this when you have no battery, then it switches to the next state.  This allows you to test battery state handly faily well and/or repurpose the battery config sections.
- **â™º Chg Screen Idle: 15m->30m** - change the time to start the screen saver; each time clicked, it changes to the next one.
- **â™º Chg System Idle: 5m->30m** - change the time to take the system down; clicking selects the next value.


Next, you may choose from various locking/blanking/DE operations:
- **â–· Lock Screen** - lock screen.
- **â–· Blank Monitors** - Blanks the screen after locking the screen.
- **â–· Reload i3** - various DE-dependent actions.
- **â–· Log Off** - terminate your user session.

Or choose a new *system state*:
- **â–¼ Suspend System** - suspends the system immediately.
- **â–¼ Reboot System** - reboots the system immediately.
- **â–¼ Poweroff System** - power down the system immediately.

Or act on the applet itself:
- **â˜“ Quit this Applet** -  exit applet.
- **â†º Restart this Applet** - restart applet.

## Per-Distro Specific Notes

### i3wm Specific Notes
* Uninstall or disable all competing energy saving programs (e.g., `xscreensaver`, `xfce4-power-manage`, etc.) which running `i3` whether started by `systemd` or `i3/config` or whatever.
* Edit `/etc/system/logind.conf` and uncomment `HandlePowerKey=`, `HandlePowerKey=`, `HandlePowerKey=`, and `HandlePowerKey=`, and set the action to `suspend` (reboot or restart `systemd-logind`).  That enables `xss-switch` to handle those keys.
* In `~/.config/i3/config`, configure something like:
```
set $screenlock i3lock -t -i ./lockpaper.png --ignore-empty-password --show-failed-attempts
exec --no-startup-id xss-lock --transfer-sleep-lock -- $screenlock --nofork
bar { 
    status_command i3status
    tray_output primary
}
exec_always --no-startup-id ~/.local/bin/pwr-tray
```
That creates handlers for those special key presses that is compatible with `pwr-tray` defaults. Vary if needed (but you might start with this suggestion).

If you `polybar` for status, then it may be best to put run of `pwr-tray` into its 'launch' scripts, and I had to run it as `env DISPLAY=:0 pwr-tray`

### KDE (X11) Specific Notes
* In Settings/Energy Saving, disable "Screen Energy Saving", "Suspend session", etc., except keep the "Button events handling" and make it as you wish (e.g., "When power button pressed", "Sleep").
